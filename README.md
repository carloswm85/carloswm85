### I'm Carlos, a web developer from Argentina. I'm currently studying at college (2 year), and giving my very first steps on front end development.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use Vue.js, php, and good practices with Python.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on front end projects (HTML, CSS/SASS, JS/Frameworks)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with nothing really. But if you want to chat about programming, I'm really open to it.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any question you may have.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me an email to carloswm.dev@gmail.com. It may or it may not take me some time to answer. Also you can contact me at LikedIn (click on the badge above).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like Chihuahuas. They're pretty cool little dogs.
