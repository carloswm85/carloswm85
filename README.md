# About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on personal projects, and as a trainee developer for my local government.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use .NET Framework, Vue.js, php, and good practices (general programming) with Python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on front end projects (HTML, CSS/SASS, JS/Frameworks) as a trainee or junior developer, though lately I'm going full-stack.
- 😃 You can check some of my GitHub stats on the link on the left hand side panel.
